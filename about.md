I'm best known for writing <em>Foiled</em> with Beth Granville. A comedy set in a hair salon, <em>Foiled</em> had a hugely successful five-star run at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2016 and was broadcast as a 4-part sitcom on [BBC Radio Wales](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08x1wcc) in July 2017.

I have also published three books of travel writing. You can find out more in [my free shop](http://davidcharles.info/shop/) or [join my weekly mailing list](http://davidcharles.info/join-mailing-list/) - freshly minted words for your delight and fascination.

Much love,
DC
