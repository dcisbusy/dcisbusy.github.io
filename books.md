I've written a number of books, freely available as ebooks or expensively available in hard copy. You're welcome. 

<h5>How It Works</h5>
If you've got money, name a fair price and the book's yours. If you haven't the money, then go ahead and download for free anyway. INSIDER TIP: On average, I tend to get $1-2 per download. That's a lot of people downloading for free and the lucky few chucking in $5 or more. It all evens out in the end. 

If you've read one of my books and would like to pay _post hoc_, I've got [a PayPal link](http://paypal.me/dcisbusy) for that. Thanks.
