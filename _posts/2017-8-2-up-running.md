I've had this blog since 2004, would you believe? In that time I've mucked around with various platforms, including
-PmWiki 2004-2006
-Joomla CMS ~2006
-Blogger 2006-2010
-Wordpress 2010-2017

But now it's time for something completely different. Wordpress is great, but it's a weighty machine and I'd like to simplify. So for now, it's Jekyll hosted on Github, run through Prose.io. Sounds complicated, but it's fast, easy to write and I understand most of it!

There won't be any comments, unless I set up a Disqus account (something I used years ago). I might just forward people to Twitter or Github if they want to chat. Probably for the best.

For now, enjoy the stripped down new look and feel the speed.
